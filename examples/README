This example is one of the many solutions found for the task presented in the
ARK2012 paper:

Design of Multi-fingered Robotic Hands for Finite and Infinitesimal Tasks using Kinematic Synthesis
E. Simo-Serra, A. Perez, H. Moon and N. Robson
Advances in Robot Kinematics (ARK), 2012

This shows how to use Lua to generate and visualize solutions. In order for
these scripts to work you'll need the synthesis.so placed where Lua can access
it. This can be solved by copying synthesis.so here.

Some things you can do:

1) Visualize the solution:
   $ lua vis.lua velsyn.lua

2) Generate more solutions:
   $ lua experiment.lua

3) Check what the Jacobian matrix looks like for different systems:
   $ lua sparsity.lua

4) Generate random topologies and solve them:
   $ lua test.lua
